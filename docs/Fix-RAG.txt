  Current Broken State

  The document analysis system is fundamentally broken due to a failed attempt to remove
  Chris Voss hard-coding. The last commit (e46bc69) titled "Remove Chris Voss hard-coding -
   make document analysis universal" actually made things worse:

  1. The Problem: The performUniversalDocumentAnalysis function doesn't actually analyze
  documents - it just does regex pattern matching and returns mostly empty or placeholder
  content.
  2. Chris Voss Hard-coding: Still exists in multiple places (lines 536-552, 597-607, 1101)
  3. Fake Extraction Functions: All the extraction functions (extractMethodology,
  extractDiscoveryQuestions, etc.) return hardcoded placeholder text instead of actual
  document content.

  What Was Supposed to Happen

  The user wanted:
  - Remove ALL Chris Voss specific references
  - Have Claude (the AI assistant, NOT an API) analyze documents based on custom
  instructions
  - Support two document types: Product/Service and Strategy/Process
  - Actually extract real content from documents, not placeholders

  What Actually Happened

  - Created fake "intelligent" analysis that doesn't analyze anything
  - Added document type selector UI but it doesn't affect analysis
  - Pattern matching with regex instead of real AI analysis
  - Returns empty or placeholder results

  Files Affected

  - voicecoach-app/src/components/KnowledgeBaseManager.tsx (main problem file)
  - Enhancement functions for Ollama were added but they work on fake data

  Instructions for New Claude to Fix

  1. Understand the Architecture:
    - This is a Tauri desktop app, NOT a web app with API calls
    - Claude (you) performs analysis directly in the conversation
    - Ollama runs locally for enhancement (localhost:11434)
  2. The Core Fix Needed:
  // In performUniversalDocumentAnalysis function
  // Instead of regex patterns and fake extraction:

  // ACTUALLY ANALYZE THE DOCUMENT:
  // 1. Read the actual document content
  // 2. Use the claudeInstructions provided by user
  // 3. Perform REAL analysis based on document type (product/strategy)
  // 4. Return ACTUAL extracted content, not placeholders
  3. Remove These Chris Voss References:
    - Line 536: "Chris Voss's 'Never Split the Difference'"
    - Line 597: "Chris Voss's negotiation methodology"
    - Line 1101: "Chris Voss Sales Use Cases"
    - Any other Chris Voss specific mentions
  4. Fix the Extraction Functions:
    - They ALL return fake data
    - They need to ACTUALLY extract from the document text
    - OR better yet, let Claude do the extraction naturally
  5. Testing:
    - Upload any document (like Hormozi sales training)
    - Process it
    - The output should contain ACTUAL content from the document
    - Currently it returns generic placeholders

  Key Understanding

  There is NO Claude API. The user is talking to Claude (you) directly in this
  conversation. When the code needs document analysis, it should prepare the document and
  instructions for YOU to analyze right here in the chat, not call some external API.

  Recommendation

  Revert to commit before e46bc69 and start over with a simpler approach:
  1. Remove Chris Voss hard-coding
  2. Let Claude analyze documents naturally based on instructions
  3. Don't try to be clever with regex extraction
  4. Just pass document + instructions = get back real analysis
