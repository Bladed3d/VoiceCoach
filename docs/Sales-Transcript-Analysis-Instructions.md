2. **Specific Language** (exact words to say, not general concepts)
3. **Situational Triggers** (when to use each technique)
4. **Recovery Strategies** (what to do when things go wrong)
5. **Measurable Outcomes** (how to know if it's working)

## FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

Structure your output as JSON for easy integration into the coaching system:

```json
{
  "document_type": "strategy",
  "source": "Sales Strategy Video Transcript Analysis",
  "speaker": "[Speaker Name]",
  "video_duration": "1.5 hours",
  "analysis_method": "Real-time coaching extraction for sales calls",
  "methodology_overview": {...},
  "discovery_framework": {...},
  "objection_handling": [...],
  "emotional_intelligence": {...},
  "conversation_dynamics": {...},
  "advancement_strategies": {...},
  "closing_techniques": [...],
  "tactical_toolbox": [...],
  "coaching_prompts": [...],
  "wisdom_nuggets": {...},
  "implementation_roadmap": {...},
  "chunk_metadata": {
    "total_tokens_estimate": 0,
    "can_chunk": true,
    "priority_sections": ["objection_handling", "tactical_toolbox", "coaching_prompts"]
  }
}
```

## CRITICAL NOTES

1. **Timestamp References**: If the transcript includes timestamps, preserve them for reference
2. **Speaker Attribution**: If multiple speakers, note who said what
3. **Confidence Levels**: If the speaker indicates some techniques work better than others, note success rates
4. **Contextual Warnings**: If speaker says "don't use this when...", capture those warnings
5. **Verbatim Examples**: When speaker provides exact dialogue, preserve it word-for-word

---

## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION

Your analysis will be used by a real-time coaching system during live sales calls. Therefore:

- **Be Specific**: Vague advice isn't actionable under pressure
- **Be Concise**: Long explanations can't be read during calls
- **Be Practical**: Focus on what can actually be DONE, not theory
- **Be Organized**: Clear categories for quick retrieval
- **Be Complete**: Don't miss any objection-handling techniques

---

## EXAMPLES OF HIGH-VALUE EXTRACTIONS

### GOOD: Specific and Actionable
```json
{
  "objection": "I need to think about it",
  "response_framework": {
    "step_1": "Acknowledge: 'I appreciate you want to make the right decision'",
    "step_2": "Probe: 'What specifically would you like to think through?'",
    "step_3": "Address: [Handle specific concern raised]",
    "step_4": "Advance: 'If we address [concern], what would be the next step?'"
  }
}
```

### POOR: Vague and Theoretical
```json
{
  "objection": "Price concerns",
  "response": "Focus on value not cost"
}
```

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Remember: The salesperson using this analysis will be in the middle of a high-pressure conversation. Every piece of information you extract should help them know EXACTLY what to say or do next. If you wouldn't be able to use it in the heat of a sales call, don't include it.

Transform this video transcript into a practical, real-time coaching system that turns sales theory into sales success.
