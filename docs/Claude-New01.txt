We had a browser version of our app that was transcribing live voice very fast and accurately
   . But it can only record one audio source and we need to be able to record video calls
  YouTube videos zoom meetings etc so we've been working on migrating to having a regular app
  is compatible with Windows and Mac computers . As part of our development platform we have
  created a bread crumbs LD debugging system to make it very easy to see what is working and
  what is not in our app. And Instead of webkit speech we have been trying to use Vosk, but
  have had various problems. Claude Frequently forgets that we're trying to move to an app and
  tries use the web version So I want to be clear that our focus is entirely on developing and
  testing the real app not using the browser on a local port . Also note that you and I Claude
  and myself are a team so please don't go off and start coding right away but rather make sure
   that we're on the same page as to our plan for moving forward after we come to a conclusion
  from a brainstorming session or discussion OK ?
