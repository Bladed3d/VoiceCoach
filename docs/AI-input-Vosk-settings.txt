you can absolutely adjust Vosk to behave more like the web API—focusing on fewer events, waiting for sentence-level completions, and reducing repeats. Vosk doesn't have a direct "wait for whole sentence" flag (sentences are inferred via silence/end-of-utterance detection), but you can control this through API settings, code logic, and model tweaks. Here's how:
1. Switch to a Larger, More Accurate Model

Small models sacrifice accuracy and robustness for speed/size, which amplifies fragmented partials. Upgrade to a medium or large English model (e.g., download vosk-model-en-us-0.22 from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models—it's ~1GB but runs well on desktop CPUs).
Why it helps: Larger models have better language modeling, leading to more stable hypotheses and improved end-of-utterance detection (they're trained on more data, so they "understand" pauses better).
In your Rust code: Just update the model_path to the new model's directory. Test accuracy—benchmarks show ~10-20% lower word error rates vs. small models.

2. API Settings in Vosk Recognizer

Vosk's Rust crate (and underlying C API) has options to influence partials and utterance detection:

recognizer.set_partial_words(false): This disables word-level breakdowns in partial results, making partials less verbose/fragmented (they become more phrase-like). Partials still occur, but they're coarser.
recognizer.set_words(true): Enables word timings in finals (useful for analysis), but doesn't affect partial frequency.
No direct "silence threshold" in the Recognizer constructor, but Vosk integrates Kaldi's VAD. To tune silence detection (e.g., require longer pauses for finals), edit the model's config files (e.g., model/conf/online.conf or model/ivector/final.dubm):

Look for params like min-silence-len (in seconds, default ~0.5— increase to 0.8-1.0 for "gentle pauses"), silence-prob-threshold (lower to make silence harder to trigger), or decoder settings like --min-active=200.
Example: Open online.conf in a text editor and add/adjust --min-silence-len=0.8. Reload the model in code.
This makes Vosk wait longer before finalizing, mimicking the web API's pause-waiting behavior.


For domain-specific coaching (e.g., sales phrases), use Recognizer::new_grm(&model, sample_rate, grammar) with a grammar JSON (array of expected words/phrases). This restricts vocabulary, improving accuracy and reducing erratic partials.

Example grammar: ["how is your golf game today", "[unk]"] (allows unknowns but biases toward full sentences).





Update your Rust code like this (in the start_transcription command):
rustlet mut recognizer = Recognizer::new(&model, 16000.0).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
recognizer.set_partial_words(false);  // Reduce word-level partials
recognizer.set_words(true);  // Optional: Get timings in finals
// If using grammar:
// let grammar = r#"["how", "is", "your", "golf", "game", "today", "[unk]"]"#;
// let mut recognizer = Recognizer::new_grm(&model, 16000.0, grammar).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
3. Code Changes to Emit Fewer Events (Focus on Finals)

The repeating events come from emitting every partial. To match the web API's "one event per sentence" style:


Option A: Only Emit Final Results (Simplest, Lowest Latency Trade-off)

Remove the partial emission entirely. Vosk will only trigger an event when accept_waveform_bytes() returns true (silence detected, utterance complete). This gives one clean event per paused sentence, just like your web version.
Updated Rust callback:
rustmove |data: &[f32], _: &cpal::InputCallbackInfo| {
    // ... (convert to i16 bytes as before)
    if recognizer.accept_waveform_bytes(bytes) {
        if let Ok(result) = recognizer.final_result() {
            if let vosk::CompleteResult::Single(res) = result {
                let payload = TranscriptionPayload { text: res.text, is_final: true };
                app.emit_all("voiceTranscription", payload).unwrap();
            }
        }
        // Optional: Reset recognizer for continuous mode if needed
    }
    // No else block: Ignore partials
}

Pros: No repeats, one event per sentence.
Cons: Slight delay (waits for pause), but you said the web version did this fabulously. For live coaching, if pauses are natural, it works; otherwise, add a timeout to force finals after X seconds.



Option B: Handle Partials Intelligently in Frontend (For Real-Time Feel)

Keep emitting partials, but in JS, use a buffer to update a single "interim" transcript (replace the old one if the new partial extends it). Only "commit" (send to Ollama) on finals. This avoids UI/app seeing repeats—it's like the web API's interimResults.
Updated JS listener:
javascriptlet currentInterim = '';  // Buffer for updating partial

const unlisten = await listen('voiceTranscription', (event) => {
  const { text, is_final } = event.payload;
  if (!is_final) {
    // Update interim only if it's a meaningful extension (avoids repeats)
    if (text.startsWith(currentInterim) && text.length > currentInterim.length) {
      currentInterim = text;
      console.log(`Interim update: ${currentInterim}`);  // Show updating text (e.g., in gray)
    }
  } else {
    // Commit final (e.g., append to full transcript, send to Ollama)
    console.log(`Final: ${text}`);
    // Ollama call here
    currentInterim = '';  // Reset
  }
});

This way, your app processes one coherent sentence per final event, without the "how is your... how is your golf..." spam.



Buffer Audio Chunks: To reduce partial calls, accumulate more audio (e.g., 0.5-1s buffers) before feeding to accept_waveform_bytes(). This lets Vosk process larger chunks, leading to fewer partials.




Additional Tips for Your Live Coaching App

Test for Latency/Accuracy: With a larger model and final-only emissions, expect near-web performance. If partials are needed for ultra-low latency (e.g., mid-sentence coaching), combine with the frontend buffer.
Continuous Mode: If users speak without pauses, add a max buffer timeout (e.g., force final after 10s via custom logic).
Noise/Accuracy Issues: If background noise triggers extras (like spurious "the"), train a custom grammar or fine-tune the model (Vosk supports adaptation).
Alternatives if Needed: If Vosk still feels off, whisper-rs (as I suggested before) has better built-in segmentation for sentences, with params like single_segment: false for streaming.

This should get Vosk much closer to your web experience—start with the larger model and final-only emissions.
