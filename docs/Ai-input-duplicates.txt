The user's approach of using std::mem::forget on the cpal::Stream and an ID-based check in the callback to disable old streams is a functional workaround for the !Send limitation, but it's not the best or most efficient method. It effectively leaks resources: Each forgotten stream keeps its underlying audio thread alive indefinitely (even if the callback early-returns), which can waste CPU cycles, memory, and potentially lead to audio device conflicts or exhaustion on repeated start/stop cycles. This is especially problematic in a long-running app like a Tauri desktop application, where resource accumulation could degrade performance over time.
A more robust and idiomatic solution is to spawn a dedicated thread that owns the Stream (confining the !Send type to that thread) and use a channel (e.g., std::sync::mpsc) to send control commands like "stop." On receiving a stop command, the thread can drop the stream (which stops it cleanly via its destructor) and exit. This avoids leaks, ensures proper cleanup, and works cross-platform without relying on optional features like Stream::pause() (which isn't supported on all backends, such as ALSA on Linux).
Recommended Implementation in Your Tauri Rust Backend
Assuming your setup from earlier (with Vosk transcription), integrate this into main.rs. Use Tauri's state to store a sender channel and thread handle for management.
rustuse std::sync::{mpsc::{self, Sender}, Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread::{self, JoinHandle};
use tauri::{Manager, State};
use cpal::traits::{DeviceTrait, HostTrait, StreamTrait};

// ... (other imports and structs as before)

struct AppState {
    model: Arc<Mutex<vosk::Model>>,
    transcription_tx: Mutex<Option<Sender<TranscriptionCommand>>>,
    thread_handle: Mutex<Option<JoinHandle<()>>>,
}

enum TranscriptionCommand {
    Start,
    Stop,
}

#[tauri::command]
fn start_transcription(app: AppHandle, model_path: String) -> Result<(), String> {
    let state: State<AppState> = app.state();
    let model = state.model.lock().unwrap().clone();  // Assuming preloaded

    // Create channel for commands
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<TranscriptionCommand>();
    {
        let mut transcription_tx = state.transcription_tx.lock().unwrap();
        *transcription_tx = Some(tx.clone());
    }

    // Spawn thread owning the stream
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let host = cpal::default_host();
        let device = host.default_input_device().ok_or("No input device").unwrap();
        let config = device.default_input_config().unwrap();

        let stream = device.build_input_stream(
            &config.into(),
            move |data: &[f32], _: &cpal::InputCallbackInfo| {
                // Your audio processing logic here (convert to i16, feed to Vosk, emit events)
                // Use rx.try_recv() if needed for in-callback stops, but primary control via drop
                let i16_data: Vec<i16> = data.iter().map(|&s| (s.clamp(-1.0, 1.0) * i16::MAX as f32) as i16).collect();
                let bytes = i16_data.as_slice().as_bytes();
                // ... (Vosk recognition and app.emit_all as before)
            },
            |err| eprintln!("Audio error: {:?}", err),
            None,
        ).unwrap();

        stream.play().unwrap();

        // Wait for stop command
        while let Ok(cmd) = rx.recv() {
            match cmd {
                TranscriptionCommand::Stop => break,  // Drop stream on stop
                _ => {},  // Handle other commands if needed
            }
        }
        // Stream drops here, stopping it
    });

    {
        let mut thread_handle = state.thread_handle.lock().unwrap();
        *thread_handle = Some(handle);
    }

    // Send start if needed, but play() already starts
    Ok(())
}

#[tauri::command]
fn stop_transcription(app: AppHandle) -> Result<(), String> {
    let state: State<AppState> = app.state();
    if let Some(tx) = state.transcription_tx.lock().unwrap().take() {
        tx.send(TranscriptionCommand::Stop).ok();  // Ignore error if thread gone
    }
    if let Some(handle) = state.thread_handle.lock().unwrap().take() {
        handle.join().unwrap();  // Wait for thread to exit (blocks briefly, but ok in command)
    }
    Ok(())
}

// In main: Initialize state with None for tx/handle
fn main() {
    // ... (load model, Builder with .manage(AppState { ... None, None }))
}

Why This is Better:

No Leaks: The stream is properly dropped on stop, releasing resources (audio device, thread).
Thread Safety: The !Send stream stays owned by one thread; channels handle cross-thread communication.
Portability: Works on all cpal backends without relying on pause/play support.
Extensibility: Add flags (e.g., Arc<AtomicBool>) shared in the callback for finer control, like early returns before full drop.
Tauri Fit: Store Send-able types (Sender, JoinHandle) in state. If join() blocking is an issue (rare for quick drops), spawn a temp thread for joining.



If your target platforms support pause (e.g., Windows/macOS only), you could store the stream in a non-Send struct and use pause/play, but the thread approach is more reliable and aligns with Rust audio community patterns (e.g., from cpal examples and forums). Test for your use case to confirm no audio glitches on drop.
