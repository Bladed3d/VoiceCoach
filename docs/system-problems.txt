Tauri Compilation Problem Summary

  The Core Issue

  Rust cannot find fundamental system libraries needed to compile any code, making Tauri
  impossible to build.

  Specific Errors

  error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  error[E0463]: can't find crate for `std`
  ld: cannot find -lkernel32: No such file or directory
  ld: cannot find -lmsvcrt: No such file or directory
  ld: cannot find crt2.o: No such file or directory

  System Configuration

  - OS: Windows (Windows 10 or 11)
  - Rust Version: 1.88.0 (installed and detected)
  - Cargo Version: 1.88.0 (installed and detected)
  - Installed Toolchains:
    - stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
    - stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (active, default)

  What's Been Tried

  1. ✅ Rust is installed (rustc --version works)
  2. ✅ Switched from GNU to MSVC toolchain
  3. ✅ Added MSVC target via rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  4. ✅ Created .cargo/config.toml with explicit MSVC target
  5. ✅ Added rust-src component
  6. ✅ Set explicit linker to link.exe
  7. ❌ Still fails - Rust can't find Windows system libraries

  The Paradox

  - Rust/Cargo commands work fine
  - But compilation fails immediately on basic crates
  - It's trying to use x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc even when configured for MSVC
  - Missing critical Windows libraries that should be available

  Previous Context

  - You spent 8 hours on this before
  - The app works fine as a web app with Tauri backend
  - Just needs to compile once to get the desktop version working
  - System audio capture is the goal (not possible in browser)

  This appears to be a Windows development environment issue where Rust's linker cannot
  locate Windows SDK libraries, despite Rust itself being properly installed.
