- **Iteration 4+**: Fine-tuning until 85% threshold achieved

#### **Quality Improvement Areas** (typical sequence):
1. **Analysis Completeness**: Ensure all document sections processed
2. **Insight Quality**: Improve depth and actionability of extracted insights
3. **Context Preservation**: Better semantic chunking and relationship mapping

## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### **High-Risk Areas**:

#### **Claude API Integration Complexity**:
- **Risk**: Real Claude analysis more complex than anticipated
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple implementation, iterate to add sophistication
- **Fallback**: Maintain fake analysis as backup during development

#### **Quality Target Achievement**:
- **Risk**: 85% quality threshold proves difficult to reach
- **Mitigation**: Break down quality into specific, measurable components
- **Fallback**: Adjust target based on user value vs implementation cost

#### **Ollama Integration Issues**:
- **Risk**: Semantic enhancement doesn't integrate smoothly
- **Mitigation**: Implement Ollama as optional enhancement, not required
- **Fallback**: Ship Claude-only analysis if Ollama causes delays

#### **Performance Concerns**:
- **Risk**: Real analysis too slow for good user experience
- **Mitigation**: Implement streaming responses and progress indicators
- **Fallback**: Async processing with email notifications for large documents

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Parallel Development**: Begin LED infrastructure while core implementation progresses
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component individually before full integration
3. **User Feedback Loop**: Involve user in quality assessment during development
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert to previous system if needed
