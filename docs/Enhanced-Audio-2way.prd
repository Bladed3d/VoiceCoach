## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform VoiceCoach from single-user microphone coaching to comprehensive two-way video conference coaching, enabling MLM sales professionals to receive real-time AI guidance during live prospect conversations.

### Market Opportunity
**Primary Target**: Utah MLM market with 200,000+ home-based sellers conducting video calls with family/friends for product sales. Current pain point: handling objections from people who know them personally.

**Business Impact**: 
- Expand addressable market from individual practice to live sales conversations
- Enable coaching during actual revenue-generating activities
- Provide competitive advantage in relationship-based selling environments

## Product Overview

### Current State
- VoiceCoach captures microphone input only
- AI coaching based on user speech patterns
- Practice-mode focused, not live conversation ready
- Limited to solo preparation sessions

### Target State  
- System audio capture including video conference calls
- Two-way conversation analysis and contextual coaching
- Real-time suggestions based on prospect responses
- Universal video platform compatibility (Zoom, Teams, Meet, Facebook Messenger)
- Seamless integration with existing VoiceCoach functionality

### Core Value Proposition
**"Get AI coaching during your actual sales calls, not just practice sessions"**

## Technical Requirements

### Audio Processing Architecture

#### Phase 1: Enhanced System Audio Capture
```rust
// Modify existing Tauri audio capture system
#[tauri::command]
async fn start_enhanced_recording() -> Result<String, String> {
    // CHANGE: From microphone capture to system audio capture
    // RESULT: Captures ALL computer audio including video calls
    // BENEFIT: Universal video platform compatibility
}
```

#### Audio Stream Processing
- **Input**: System audio stream (mixed user + prospect voices)
- **Processing**: Real-time transcription via existing Whisper integration  
- **Output**: Contextual AI coaching suggestions based on conversation flow
- **Latency Target**: <2 seconds from speech to coaching suggestion

#### Integration Points

- Enhance audio capture to include all system audio (video calls + user voice)
- Maintain all existing transcription and AI processing functionality
- Test system audio capture across Windows/Mac platforms
- Preserve current Web Speech API integration as fallback option
- Document changes to existing audio architecture

**Success Criteria**: System audio capture works with existing VoiceCoach functionality intact

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance & Debugging (Days 4-5)
**Deploy After Phase 1 Implementation**:
