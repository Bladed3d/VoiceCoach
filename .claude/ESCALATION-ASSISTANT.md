When user says: **"escalate"** ‚Üí Claude initiates guided escalation form

## **CLAUDE ESCALATION FORM WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Initialize Escalation**
**Claude Response:**
```
üö® ESCALATION ASSISTANT ACTIVATED

I'll walk you through a quick form to ensure we capture all the details needed for PM2 to resolve this completely.

ESCALATION FORM:
Task Agent: project-manager2
Prompt: "PROBLEM ESCALATION: [Will be filled as we go]

---

STEP 1/4: What are you currently seeing?
Please describe what's on your screen OR paste a screenshot.
(Screenshots are preferred - they give the debugging agent visual confirmation)
```

### **Step 2: Capture Expected Behavior**
**Claude Response After User Provides Issue:**
```
‚úÖ ISSUE CAPTURED: [User's description/screenshot]

---

STEP 2/4: What did you expect to see instead?
Please describe the expected behavior. **IMPORTANT**: For interface design, provide a SCREENSHOT rather than a URL to prevent agents from copying old deprecated code.

**PREFERRED:**
- Screenshot of the interface you want to match
- "Should display Activity Grid with draggable items" 
- Visual description of expected layout

**AVOID URLs** (agents may copy old code instead of building fresh):
- ‚ùå "Should show timeline like https://daily-actions4" (agent copies React Beautiful DnD)
- ‚úÖ "Should match this interface: [screenshot]" (agent builds with DnD Kit)
```

### **Step 3: Add Context (Optional)**
**Claude Response After User Provides Expected Behavior:**
```
‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CAPTURED: [User's expectation]

---

STEP 3/4: Any additional context? (Optional)
Examples:
- What were you trying to do when this happened?
- Did this work before? When did it break?
- Any specific errors you noticed?
- Which browser/device are you using?

Type "none" to skip this step.
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Confirmation**
**Claude Response After Context (or Skip):**
```
‚úÖ CONTEXT CAPTURED: [User's context or "none"]

---

ESCALATION SUMMARY:
OBSERVED ISSUE: [User's description/screenshot]
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: [User's expectation]
CONTEXT: [User's context or "Minimal context provided"]

STEP 4/4: Deploy Escalation?
Y - Deploy PM2 with full authority to resolve this
N - Cancel escalation
C - Add comments/modifications before deploying

Your choice: Y/N/C
```

### **Step 5A: Deploy (If Y)**
**Claude Response:**
```
‚úÖ ESCALATION DEPLOYED

**CORRECTED ESCALATION PROTOCOL:**
I will now function as the Project Manager and follow the instructions in .claude\project-manager2.md

Let me read the project manager instructions and execute the escalation protocol as PM2:

[Claude reads D:\Projects\Ai\Apps\Life-Designer\sub-projects\Lightwalker\.claude\project-manager2.md]
[Claude functions as Project Manager following that file's Problem Escalation Protocol]

üéØ PM2 escalation protocol is now executing. You'll receive updates as agents are deployed and the issue is resolved.
```

### **Step 5B: Comments (If C)**
**Claude Response:**
```
Please provide your additional comments or modifications:
(After you provide them, I'll ask again: Deploy Escalation? Y/N)
```

### **Step 5C: Cancel (If N)**
**Claude Response:**
```
‚ùå Escalation cancelled. 

If you change your mind, just say "escalate" again to restart the form.
```
