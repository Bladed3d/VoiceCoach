## üö® Critical Error Analysis with LED Breadcrumb Evidence

### Primary Error: Tauri Desktop Context Failure

**LED Evidence**: LED 210 repeated failures in `useAudioProcessor`  
**Error Pattern**: `window.__TAURI_IPC__ is not a function`  
**Impact**: Complete coaching pipeline failure

**Cascade Effect Detected**:
1. Audio processor initialization fails
2. Coaching orchestrator cannot access backend
3. OpenRouter API integration blocked
4. Real-time coaching prompts unavailable
5. End-to-end pipeline non-functional

### LED Breadcrumb Error Capture Analysis

**‚úÖ LED System Performance**:
- LED breadcrumb infrastructure successfully deployed across all components
- Error capture working perfectly - all failures being tracked with precise timestamps
- Breadcrumb numbering system correctly implemented (100-199, 200-299, etc.)
- Debug commands accessible in browser console for real-time analysis

**üìä LED Event Analysis**:
```javascript
LED Range Coverage (8 total events captured):
- User Interactions (100-199): 0 events - UI blocked by backend failures
- API Operations (200-299): 0 events - Tauri commands inaccessible
- State Management (300-399): 3 events - App initialization only
- UI Operations (400-499): 5 events - Basic app rendering
- Audio Processing (600-699): 0 events - Audio hooks failing
- AI Coordination (700-799): 0 events - Backend unavailable  
- Coaching Logic (800-899): 0 events - Core functionality blocked
```

**üîç Error Location Precision**:
- LED 210: Audio processor validation failures
- LED 400: App component initialization successful
- LED 300-301: State management working correctly
- Missing LEDs 600-899: Core coaching pipeline not operational

## ‚ö° Performance Target Validation

### Current Performance vs Phase 3 Targets

**All Performance Targets FAILED** due to system not operational:
- **Coaching Response**: Target <2000ms, Actual: 0ms (system blocked)
- **Transcription**: Target <500ms, Actual: 0ms (audio processing failed)
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Target <100ms, Actual: 0ms (backend inaccessible)
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Target <2000ms, Actual: Failed to initialize

**Performance Impact**: While the architecture is designed to meet all targets, Tauri integration failure prevents meaningful performance measurement.

---

## üîß Error Correction Agent Requirements

### Priority 1: Resolve Tauri Desktop Integration (CRITICAL)
**Immediate Action**: Deploy VoiceCoach as Tauri desktop application instead of browser mode

**Commands for Error Correction Agent**:
```bash
cd voicecoach-app
npm run tauri build  # For production
# OR
npm run tauri dev    # For development testing
```

**Expected Resolution**: Enable `window.__TAURI_IPC__` functionality for OpenRouter and audio processing

### Priority 2: Validate Complete Backend Integration (HIGH)
**Post-Desktop Deploy**: Confirm all Tauri commands operational
- Test OpenRouter integration commands
- Validate audio processing command implementations  
- Verify knowledge base integration functionality

### Priority 3: Complete End-to-End Testing (MEDIUM)
**Final Validation**: Re-run automated testing in desktop mode
- Validate <2s coaching response pipeline
- Confirm LED breadcrumb captures successful operations
- Test real-time coaching prompt generation
