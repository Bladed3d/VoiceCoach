# Product Requirements Document: Vosk-Based Real-Time Transcription Implementation

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The VoiceCoach application has successfully migrated from a web-based architecture to Tauri desktop, enabling robust system audio capture and AI coaching features. However, the transcription system is currently broken due to the Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`) being unavailable in Tauri's WebView environment. This critical functionality gap prevents users from seeing real-time transcriptions in the right panel, severely impacting the core user experience.

### Solution Overview
Implement Vosk (open-source, offline speech-to-text) as a Rust-based transcription service integrated with the existing Tauri backend. Vosk provides:
- **Offline Processing**: No external API dependencies or data privacy concerns
- **Real-time Streaming**: Supports partial results and continuous transcription
- **Language Model Flexibility**: Multiple language support and model size options
- **Rust Integration**: Native Rust bindings available for seamless Tauri integration

### Expected Outcomes
- **Immediate User Value**: Real-time transcriptions appear in right panel within 500ms of speech
- **Enhanced Privacy**: All transcription processing happens locally
- **Improved Performance**: No network latency or API rate limiting
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent transcription quality across Windows/Mac/Linux

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Core Vosk Integration (Rust Backend)

#### 1.1 Vosk Library Setup
```rust
// Add to Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
vosk = "0.3.32"
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
cpal = "0.15" // Already integrated
```

#### 1.2 Vosk Model Management
- **Model Storage**: Download and cache Vosk models in `~/.voicecoach/models/`
- **Model Selection**: Start with `vosk-model-en-us-0.22` (40MB) for development
- **Model Loading**: Lazy initialization on first transcription request
- **Model Updates**: Automatic model verification and re-download if corrupted

#### 1.3 Real-time Audio Processing Pipeline
```rust
Audio Input (CPAL) → Audio Buffer → Vosk Recognition → 
Partial Results → Final Results → Tauri Events → Frontend Display
```

#### 1.4 Vosk Integration Points
- **Audio Format**: Convert CPAL f32 samples to Vosk-compatible 16-bit PCM
- **Sample Rate**: Consistent 16kHz processing (downsample from 48kHz if needed)
- **Buffer Management**: 1024-sample chunks for optimal latency vs accuracy
- **Recognition State**: Maintain Vosk recognizer instance per audio session

### 2. Event System Integration

#### 2.1 Tauri Command Interface
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn start_vosk_transcription() -> Result<String, String>

#[tauri::command] 
async fn stop_vosk_transcription() -> Result<String, String>

#[tauri::command]
async fn get_vosk_status() -> Result<VoskStatus, String>

#[tauri::command]
async fn download_vosk_model(model_name: String) -> Result<ModelStatus, String>
```

#### 2.2 Real-time Event Emission
```typescript
// Frontend event listeners
window.__TAURI__.event.listen('vosk-partial-result', (event) => {
  // Handle partial transcription results
  updateTranscriptionPanel(event.payload.text, false);
});

window.__TAURI__.event.listen('vosk-final-result', (event) => {
  // Handle final transcription results
  updateTranscriptionPanel(event.payload.text, true);
});
```

#### 2.3 Event Payload Structure
```json
{
  "text": "partial transcription text",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "is_final": false,
  "speaker": "user|system",
  "duration_ms": 234
}
```

### 3. Performance Requirements

#### 3.1 Latency Targets
- **Partial Results**: < 200ms from speech start
- **Final Results**: < 500ms from speech end  
- **Model Loading**: < 3 seconds on first initialization
- **Memory Usage**: < 150MB additional RAM during active transcription

#### 3.2 Accuracy Requirements
