```javascript
// LED 480: Questionnaire initialization
if (questionnaireData.currentQuestion === 1 && !questionnaireData.isComplete) {
  trail.light(480, {
    operation: 'questionnaire_initialization',
    document_type: questionnaireData.documentType || 'not_selected',
    current_question: questionnaireData.currentQuestion
  });
}

// LED 481-489: Full range implemented for each operation
```

## Issues Found & Recommendations
