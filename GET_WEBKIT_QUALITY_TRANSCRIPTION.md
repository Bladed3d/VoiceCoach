# 🎯 Get WebKit-Quality Transcription in VoiceCoach

## The Problem
Vosk offline transcription is terrible compared to WebKit Speech API:
- Vosk: ~60-70% accuracy, many errors
- WebKit/Google: 99%+ accuracy, near perfect

## The Solution: Deepgram
We've integrated Deepgram for production-quality transcription that matches WebKit!

### Why Deepgram?
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ (same as Google/WebKit)
- **Speed**: <300ms latency (faster than WebKit)
- **Cost**: $0.0059/minute (only $0.35/hour)
- **FREE Credits**: $200 free = 555+ hours!
- **Features**: Punctuation, speaker detection, real-time streaming

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.deepgram.com/signup
2. Sign up (no credit card required)
3. Get $200 in free credits instantly
4. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Add to VoiceCoach
Create a `.env` file in `voicecoach-app/`:

```

### 3. Test It

## Code Integration

The app automatically uses Deepgram when an API key is present:

```typescript
// In your frontend code
const startRecording = async () => {
  if (hasDeepgramKey) {
    // Uses Deepgram (WebKit quality!)
    await invoke('start_deepgram_transcription', { 
      api_key: process.env.REACT_APP_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY 
    });
  } else {
    // Falls back to Vosk (offline, lower quality)
    await invoke('start_vosk_transcription');
  }
};
```
