## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
```typescript
App.tsx                 // Main application state management
├── StatusBar           // System status, recording controls
├── CoachingInterface   // Primary coaching interface
│   ├── TranscriptionPanel    // Live conversation display  
│   ├── CoachingPrompts      // AI coaching suggestions
│   └── AudioVisualizer     // Real-time audio monitoring
└── SettingsPanel      // Configuration management
```

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
```rust
main.rs                 // Desktop app entry point
├── initialize_voicecoach()   // System initialization
├── start_recording()         // Audio capture start
├── stop_recording()          // Session cleanup
├── get_audio_devices()       // Hardware enumeration
├── process_transcription()   // Audio → text processing
└── get_coaching_suggestions() // AI prompt generation
```

### Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- **Custom Color Palette**: Primary (blue), Success (green), Warning (yellow), Danger (red)
- **Glass Morphism**: Backdrop-blur panels for modern coaching interface
- **Animation System**: Pulse, glow, fade-in effects for engagement
