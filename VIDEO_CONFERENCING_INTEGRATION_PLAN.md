# VoiceCoach Video Conferencing Integration Plan

## Current Challenge
VoiceCoach currently captures single-user audio input. For real sales coaching scenarios, we need to capture and analyze two-way conversations from video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams).

## Integration Approaches

### 1. Enhanced System Audio Capture (MVP - Week 1)
**Implementation**: Upgrade existing audio capture to process system audio

```rust
// Enhanced Tauri audio capture
#[tauri::command]
async fn start_system_audio_capture() -> Result<String, String> {
    // Capture all system audio (includes video call audio)
    // Use AI-based speaker separation
    // Identify user vs prospect voices
    // Provide dual-channel coaching
}
```

**Features**:
- Capture system audio including video calls
- AI voice separation to identify speakers
- Separate coaching suggestions for user vs prospect speech
- Works with any video platform immediately

**Pros**: Quick implementation, universal compatibility
**Cons**: Captures all system audio, requires voice separation AI

### 2. Virtual Audio Device Integration (Professional - Week 2-3)
**Implementation**: Virtual audio routing through VoiceCoach

```javascript
// Virtual audio setup workflow
const setupVirtualAudio = {
  step1: "Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable",
  step2: "Configure Zoom/Meet to use VoiceCoach Virtual Mic",
  step3: "Route audio through VoiceCoach for processing",
  step4: "Forward clean audio to real speakers",
  step5: "Provide real-time coaching overlay"
}
```

**User Workflow**:
1. Launch VoiceCoach before video call
2. Set VoiceCoach Virtual Mic as Zoom/Meet microphone
3. VoiceCoach captures, processes, and forwards audio
4. Real-time coaching appears in VoiceCoach interface
5. Clean audio forwarding maintains call quality

**Pros**: Professional setup, clean audio separation, works with all platforms
**Cons**: Requires virtual audio driver installation, more complex setup

### 3. Platform Bot Integration (Enterprise - Week 4-8)
**Implementation**: Official platform bot that joins calls

#### Google Meet Bot Integration
```javascript
// Google Meet API integration
const meetBotIntegration = {
  authentication: "Google Cloud Service Account",
  permissions: ["calendar.events", "meet.recordings"],
  bot_functionality: {
    join_meeting: "Automatic via calendar integration",
    record_audio: "Separate channels for each participant",
    real_time_processing: "Live coaching suggestions",
    participant_identification: "By Google Meet participant data"
  }
}
```

#### Zoom Bot Integration
```javascript
// Zoom SDK integration
const zoomBotIntegration = {
  sdk: "Zoom Video SDK",
  authentication: "Zoom App Marketplace",
  capabilities: {
    join_as_participant: true,
    separate_audio_streams: true,
    real_time_transcription: true,
    overlay_coaching_ui: true
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Official platform support, perfect audio separation, enterprise features
**Cons**: Complex development, platform-specific code, authentication overhead

### 4. Browser Extension Integration (Week 3-4)
**Implementation**: Chrome/Edge extension for web-based calls

```javascript
// Browser extension for web video calls
const extensionIntegration = {
  platforms: ["Google Meet", "Zoom Web", "Teams Web"],
  audio_capture: "getDisplayMedia() with audio",
  real_time_processing: "WebSocket to VoiceCoach desktop app",
  ui_overlay: "Injected coaching interface",
  permissions: ["activeTab", "desktopCapture", "microphone"]
}
```
