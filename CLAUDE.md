# Lightwalker Project - Master Index

## üö® CRITICAL AGENT NAMING CLARIFICATION
**When using Task tool with custom agents**: Use the agent's **name** field from the .md file header, NOT the filename!
- Example: File `task-breakdown-agent.md` has `name: Task Breakdown Agent` 
- **USE**: `subagent_type: "Task Breakdown Agent"`
- **NOT**: `subagent_type: "task-breakdown-agent"`

## üö® MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL

**EVERY conversation MUST begin by reading these files in order:**

1. **`CLAUDE-SOP-SYSTEM.md`** ‚Üê Complete Standard Operating Procedures
2. **`CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md`** ‚Üê Rules that MUST NEVER be violated  
3. **`CLAUDE-MISTAKES-LOG.md`** ‚Üê Every past failure documented with solutions
4. **`CLAUDE-SUCCESS-PATTERNS.md`** ‚Üê Proven approaches that work reliably
5. **`COMMANDS-LEARNED.md`** ‚Üê System-specific command database

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: "Mistakes or errors never happen twice if we resolve them after happening once."

**VALIDATION PROCESS**: Before executing ANY action:
- ‚úÖ Check mistakes log for similar attempts
- ‚úÖ Verify approach in success patterns  
- ‚úÖ Confirm command in learned database
- ‚úÖ If new/untested ‚Üí ASK permission first
- ‚úÖ Document outcome in appropriate file

---

## ‚ö° QUICK REFERENCE

**Critical Commands** (Details in LIGHTWALKER-TECHNICAL-SPECS.md):
- `npm run build` ‚Üê ALWAYS use this (never `npm run dev`)
- Check `CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md` before ANY system command

**Deployment Rules** (Details in CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md):
- ALWAYS ask permission before git push or deployment
- Batch 3-5 changes together (Vercel 100/day limit)

**Development Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS

**IMPORTANT**: This master index provides entry points to detailed information. Read the specific reference files for complete context on any topic.

## üî¥ CRITICAL QUALITY PRINCIPLE - VOICECOACH PROJECT

**NEVER COMPROMISE QUALITY FOR SPEED**

The user has explicitly stated:
- "I never want to compromise quality for speed"
- "I want a great app that's working properly" 
- "Not at the expense of quality and proper robust design"
- "I am tired of Claude constantly suggesting short term fixes rather than robust and proper solutions"

**MANDATORY APPROACH FOR VOICECOACH:**
1. ‚úÖ ALWAYS implement robust, production-ready solutions
2. ‚úÖ ALWAYS think about error handling, edge cases, and sustainability
3. ‚úÖ ALWAYS consider what happens when real users use the system
4. ‚úÖ ALWAYS build with deployment and scale in mind
5. ‚ùå NEVER take shortcuts just to get something "working" quickly
6. ‚ùå NEVER implement quick fixes that will cause debugging problems later
7. ‚ùå NEVER use mock data or simulated functionality when real implementation is needed

**Example**: When implementing transcription:
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Let's just simulate transcription to test quickly"
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: "Let's properly integrate a real transcription service (Whisper/AssemblyAI/Deepgram) with proper error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms"

**The goal is a robust, sustainable app that works reliably for actual users, not a quick demo that appears to work but fails in production.**

## üöÄ STANDARD DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**THREE-PHASE DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL**

### Phase 1: Implementation (Lead Programmer)
When implementing new features or fixing bugs:
```
1. Deploy Lead Programmer agent for implementation
   - subagent_type: "Lead Programmer"
   - Task: Implement the feature/fix with production quality
```

### Phase 2: LED Integration (Breadcrumbs Agent)
After implementation is complete:
```
2. Deploy Breadcrumbs Agent to add debugging infrastructure
   - subagent_type: "Breadcrumbs Agent"  
   - Task: Add LED breadcrumb tracking to new code
```

### Phase 3: Testing (Claude Orchestration)
After LED integration:
```
3. Execute testing orchestration directly (NOT as agent)
   - Read: docs/CLAUDE-TESTING-ORCHESTRATION-PLAYBOOK.md
   - Follow the playbook steps using Playwright tools
   - Validate LED chain and functionality
```

## üö® MANDATORY TESTING & FIXING PROTOCOL - VOICECOACH PROJECT

**NEVER DECLARE "READY" WITHOUT TESTING AND FIXING ALL ISSUES**

### üîÑ Continuous Development Loop (MUST COMPLETE ALL)
```
1. Lead Programmer ‚Üí Implements feature/fix
2. Breadcrumbs Agent ‚Üí Adds LED tracking  
3. Claude Testing ‚Üí Tests and finds issues
4. If issues found:
   a. Check CLAUDE-MISTAKES-LOG.md for known solutions
   b. Check CLAUDE-SUCCESS-PATTERNS.md for proven fixes
   c. If no solution found ‚Üí Deploy Researcher agent
   d. Send findings to Lead Programmer
5. Lead Programmer ‚Üí AUTOMATICALLY FIXES issues (no reporting without fixing!)
6. REPEAT steps 3-5 until ALL tests pass
7. ONLY THEN declare ready
```

### Critical Understanding for Testing
**Before ANY testing, Claude MUST understand:**
- VoiceCoach is transitioning from browser app to FULL TAURI DESKTOP APP
- All functionality must work in desktop mode, NOT browser mode
- Mock implementations are temporary and must be replaced with real Tauri APIs
- If unclear about ANY requirement ‚Üí ASK FIRST, don't assume

### After ANY Code Changes
**MUST RUN IMMEDIATELY:**
```bash
npm run build  # Catch syntax errors
npm run lint   # Catch code issues  
npm run test   # Run test suite (if exists)
```

### Testing Orchestration Protocol
**Claude MUST:**
1. Read PRD and understand desktop app requirements
2. Execute testing per CLAUDE-TESTING-ORCHESTRATION-PLAYBOOK.md
3. When issues found ‚Üí Deploy Lead Programmer IMMEDIATELY to fix
4. Re-test after each fix
5. Continue loop until ALL tests pass
6. Verify LED chain (480‚Üí489‚Üí500 for document processing)
7. Quality score must be ‚â•85%

### Testing Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Tested**: All tests passed after latest changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Changes Untested**: Code modified since last test run
- ‚ùå **Tests Failing**: Known failures requiring fixes

### Auto-Testing Triggers
**Automatically run tests when modifying:**
- `KnowledgeBaseManager.tsx`
- `useCoachingOrchestrator.ts`
- `useAudioProcessor.ts`
- Any Tauri backend files
- Any critical system components

### Testing Failure = Auto-Fix Required
**If ANY of these occur, AUTO-FIX PROTOCOL ACTIVATES:**
- Syntax errors preventing compilation
- Stage 1 not progressing to Stage 2
- LED chain incomplete or missing events
- "Local Analysis Fallback" appearing
- Quality score <85%
- Manual intervention required
- Timeout errors (unless false positive from testing)

**Auto-Fix Protocol:**
1. Check CLAUDE-MISTAKES-LOG.md for documented solution
2. If not found ‚Üí Deploy Researcher agent for investigation
3. Deploy Lead Programmer with findings to implement fix
4. Re-test until issue resolved
5. Document solution in appropriate knowledge files

### Testing Documentation
**Every test run MUST produce:**
- Test report in `test-results/` folder
- LED trace log
- Quality metrics
- Pass/fail status for each phase
- Timestamp and duration

**REMEMBER**: Having a sophisticated testing system means nothing if it's not used. The Claude Tester Agent must be invoked BEFORE declaring any system ready.
