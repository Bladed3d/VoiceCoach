# Lightwalker Project - Master Index

## üö® CRITICAL AGENT NAMING CLARIFICATION
**When using Task tool with custom agents**: Use the agent's **name** field from the .md file header, NOT the filename!
- Example: File `task-breakdown-agent.md` has `name: Task Breakdown Agent` 
- **USE**: `subagent_type: "Task Breakdown Agent"`
- **NOT**: `subagent_type: "task-breakdown-agent"`

## üö® MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL

**EVERY conversation MUST begin by reading these files in order:**

1. **`CLAUDE-SOP-SYSTEM.md`** ‚Üê Complete Standard Operating Procedures
2. **`CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md`** ‚Üê Rules that MUST NEVER be violated  
3. **`CLAUDE-MISTAKES-LOG.md`** ‚Üê Every past failure documented with solutions
4. **`CLAUDE-SUCCESS-PATTERNS.md`** ‚Üê Proven approaches that work reliably
5. **`COMMANDS-LEARNED.md`** ‚Üê System-specific command database
6. **`CLAUDE-PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`** ‚Üê Current project status and next steps

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: "Mistakes or errors never happen twice if we resolve them after happening once."

**VALIDATION PROCESS**: Before executing ANY action:
- ‚úÖ Check mistakes log for similar attempts
- ‚úÖ Verify approach in success patterns  
- ‚úÖ Confirm command in learned database
- ‚úÖ If new/untested ‚Üí ASK permission first
- ‚úÖ Document outcome in appropriate file

## ‚ö° QUICK REFERENCE

**Critical Commands** (Details in LIGHTWALKER-TECHNICAL-SPECS.md):
- `npm run build` ‚Üê ALWAYS use this (never `npm run dev`)
- Check `CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md` before ANY system command

**Deployment Rules** (Details in CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md):
- ALWAYS ask permission before git push or deployment
- Batch 3-5 changes together (Vercel 100/day limit)

**Development Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS

## üî¥ CRITICAL QUALITY PRINCIPLE - VOICECOACH PROJECT

**NEVER COMPROMISE QUALITY FOR SPEED**

The user has explicitly stated:
- "I never want to compromise quality for speed"
- "I want a great app that's working properly" 
- "Not at the expense of quality and proper robust design"
- "I am tired of Claude constantly suggesting short term fixes rather than robust and proper solutions"

**MANDATORY APPROACH FOR VOICECOACH:**
1. ‚úÖ ALWAYS implement robust, production-ready solutions
2. ‚úÖ ALWAYS think about error handling, edge cases, and sustainability
3. ‚úÖ ALWAYS consider what happens when real users use the system
4. ‚úÖ ALWAYS build with deployment and scale in mind
5. ‚ùå NEVER take shortcuts just to get something "working" quickly
6. ‚ùå NEVER implement quick fixes that will cause debugging problems later
7. ‚ùå NEVER use mock data or simulated functionality when real implementation is needed

**Example**: When implementing transcription:
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Let's just simulate transcription to test quickly"
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: "Let's properly integrate a real transcription service (Whisper/AssemblyAI/Deepgram) with proper error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms"

**The goal is a robust, sustainable app that works reliably for actual users, not a quick demo that appears to work but fails in production.**
