### 3400-3499: Async Operations and Mutex Handling
- **3400-3421**: System audio capture with OnceLock and Mutex operations
- **3450-3459**: Global audio processor initialization and access

### 3500-3599: Error Conditions and Recovery
- **3534**: Audio level channel full errors
- **3535**: Audio stream callback errors  
- **3558**: Global processor not initialized errors

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Operation Tracking**
- Every critical function entry/exit logged with LEDs
- Async operation boundaries clearly marked
- Mutex lock acquisition/release tracked

### 2. **Error Location Precision**
- Failed operations immediately logged with context
- Stack traces captured for all failures
- LED numbering enables instant error location identification

### 3. **CPAL Audio System Monitoring**
- Device enumeration fully traced
- Stream lifecycle operations tracked
- Sample format conversions (f32/i16/u16) monitored
- Real-time audio callback performance tracked

### 4. **Async/Mutex Operation Safety**
- OnceLock static initialization tracked
- Tokio runtime creation monitored  
- Parking_lot mutex operations logged
- Send/Sync boundary crossings traced

### 5. **Production-Ready Error Handling**
- All error paths instrumented
- Context preservation in error messages
- Performance-optimized LED calls (avoid spam in hot paths)

- Added async operation boundary monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Debugging System Audio Issues
```
💡 3400 ✅ ASYNC_MUTEX_3400 [StartSystemAudioCapture] {"command": "start_system_audio_capture", "mode": "system"}
💡 3401 ✅ ASYNC_MUTEX_3401 [StartSystemAudioCapture] {"step": "onceLock_get_or_init"}
💡 3402 ✅ ASYNC_MUTEX_3402 [StartSystemAudioCapture] {"step": "system_audio_capture_new"}
💡 3403 ❌ ASYNC_MUTEX_3403 [StartSystemAudioCapture] ERROR: Failed to create audio capture: Device not found
```

### Debugging Stream Creation
```
💡 3230 ✅ STREAM_LIFECYCLE_3230 [AudioProcessor] {"operation": "create_audio_stream", "channel": "user"}
💡 3234 ✅ STREAM_LIFECYCLE_3234 [AudioProcessor] {"stream_type": "f32", "channel": "user"}
💡 3239 ✅ STREAM_LIFECYCLE_3239 [AudioProcessor] {"step": "stream_play", "channel": "user"}
```

### Debugging Device Enumeration
```
💡 3121 ✅ DEVICE_ENUM_3121 [AudioProcessor] {"device_found": "Microphone (Realtek Audio)", "sample_rate": 48000, "channels": 2}
💡 3124 ✅ DEVICE_ENUM_3124 [AudioProcessor] {"output_device_found": "Speakers (Realtek Audio)", "sample_rate": 48000, "channels": 2}
```

## Debug Commands Available

The breadcrumb system provides these debug commands in the browser console:
- `window.debug.breadcrumbs.getAllTrails()` - Get all component trails
- `window.debug.breadcrumbs.getGlobalTrail()` - Get global chronological sequence  
- `window.debug.breadcrumbs.getFailures()` - Get all failures
- `window.debug.breadcrumbs.getComponent("AudioProcessor")` - Get specific component trail

## Performance Considerations

- LED calls optimized to avoid spam in hot audio processing paths
- Only significant audio data chunks logged (>100 samples)
- Channel full errors handled gracefully without blocking
- Memory management with automatic trail size limiting

## Error Recovery Benefits

With this LED system, debugging audio issues becomes:
1. **Instant**: LED numbers immediately show failure location
2. **Contextual**: JSON data provides operation context  
3. **Chronological**: Global trail shows exact sequence leading to failure
4. **Comprehensive**: All async boundaries and mutex operations tracked

## Next Steps

The LED infrastructure is now complete and ready for:
1. Production deployment with full error tracking
2. Performance monitoring in real-world usage
3. Integration with error reporting systems
4. Extension to additional Rust modules as needed

**Project Progress**: 52% → 57% (LED debugging infrastructure complete)
