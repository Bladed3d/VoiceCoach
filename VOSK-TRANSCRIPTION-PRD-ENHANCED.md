# Product Requirements Document: Vosk Real-Time Transcription Integration

## Executive Summary
The VoiceCoach application migrated from web to Tauri desktop but lost transcription functionality. Web version used webkitSpeechRecognition which doesn't work in Tauri WebView. Currently no transcriptions appear in right panel though audio capture and Ollama coaching work.

Solution: Implement Vosk offline speech recognition in Rust backend for real-time streaming transcription with zero API costs.

## Technical Requirements
- Vosk 0.3.1 integration in Rust
- 16kHz sample rate, 16-bit PCM mono
- <200ms partial results, <500ms final results
- Model: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 (40MB initial)
- Event emission via Tauri to frontend

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Vosk Integration (3-4 days)
- Add Vosk dependencies to Cargo.toml
- Download and integrate Vosk model
- Create standalone Vosk test module
- Implement audio format conversion (f32→i16)
- Test transcription with WAV file at public/test-audio/sales-call-sample.wav

### Phase 2: Event System Connection (2-3 days)
- Add AppHandle to TranscriptionManager
- Implement emit_transcription_event method
- Wire up transcription manager in main.rs
- Test event emission with mock data
- Verify frontend receives events

### Phase 3: Audio Pipeline Integration (2-3 days)
- Integrate with existing CPAL audio capture
- Implement audio buffering strategy
- Handle continuous streaming
- Add partial result support
- Coordinate with Ollama pipeline

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (2-3 days)
- Test with test-audio/sales-call-sample.wav
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Memory leak detection
- Cross-platform testing (Windows focus)
- Error recovery testing

## Files to Modify
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml (dependencies)
- src-tauri/src/transcription_service.rs (implement Vosk)
- src-tauri/src/audio_processing.rs (connect audio)
- src-tauri/src/main.rs (wire up manager)
- src/components/TranscriptionPanel.tsx (Tauri events)

## Success Criteria
- Transcriptions appear in right panel within 500ms
- Partial results show as user speaks
- CPU usage <15%, Memory <150MB additional
- Works completely offline
- Integrates with existing Ollama coaching

Create organized project folder at .pipeline/vosk-transcription/ and detailed task breakdown for dashboard-trackable progress with 2-3 day milestone updates.

# TASK BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS

## PROJECT BREAKDOWN: Vosk Real-Time Transcription Integration
**COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT**: MODERATE (Multi-Component Level)
**TOTAL PHASES**: 5 (4 development phases + 1 planning phase)
**ESTIMATED SUB-TASKS**: 16 total tasks
**DASHBOARD UPDATE FREQUENCY**: Every 2-3 sub-tasks completed
**PLANNING PERCENTAGE**: 25% (4 planning tasks / 16 total tasks)

## PARALLEL EXECUTION PLAN

### Independent Task Groups
**Parallel Group A**: Documentation and Setup (Tasks 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
- Foundation work that enables all subsequent development
- Can execute simultaneously with no dependencies

**Parallel Group B**: Core Implementation (Tasks 1.1, 2.1, 3.1) 
- Each targets different system components
- Can be developed in parallel once planning is complete

**Sequential Dependencies**:
- Planning Phase → ALL development phases
- Task 1.3 depends on Task 1.1 (dependencies before testing)
- Task 2.2 depends on Task 2.1 (event system before integration)
- Task 3.2 depends on Task 3.1 (backend before frontend)

### Parallel Efficiency Calculation
- **Traditional Sequential Time**: 16 sub-tasks × 1 unit = 16 time units
- **Parallel Independent Time**: 4 groups × 4 parallel = 4 time units (75% faster)
- **Pipeline Overlap Time**: Implementation + Quality gates overlap = 50% faster
