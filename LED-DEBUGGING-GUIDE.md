## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic LED Tracing
```rust
// In your Rust code
light_led!("audio_capture", 200, {"action": "initialization_start"});

// With error handling
match some_operation() {
    Ok(result) => {
        light_led!("audio_capture", 201, {"action": "operation_success", "result": result});
    }
    Err(e) => {
        fail_led!("audio_capture", 201, format!("Operation failed: {}", e));
    }
}
```

### Debug Commands
```rust
// Get all breadcrumb trails
let debug_info = invoke('get_breadcrumb_debug_info').await;

// Access specific component trails
let audio_trail = debug_commands::get_component_trail("audio_capture");

// Get performance summary
let summary = debug_commands::get_performance_summary();
```

### Console Output Examples

// Access breadcrumb data
const debugInfo = await invoke<BreadcrumbDebugInfo>('get_breadcrumb_debug_info');
```

### Backend Integration
```rust
// Initialize breadcrumb system
GLOBAL_BREADCRUMB_SYSTEM.lock()?.register_component("your_component");

// Use macros for easy tracing
light_led!("your_component", 123, {"key": "value"});
fail_led!("your_component", 123, "Error message");
```

## üö® Critical Error Patterns

### Common Failure Points
1. **LED 201**: Device manager initialization - Check WASAPI availability
2. **LED 212**: Microphone detection - Verify microphone permissions
3. **LED 216**: Audio client creation - Check device compatibility
4. **LED 311**: Buffer management - Monitor memory usage
5. **LED 316**: Noise reduction - Check audio format compatibility

### Error Recovery Strategies
- **Device failures**: Retry with different devices
- **Buffer overflows**: Increase buffer sizes or processing speed
- **Permission issues**: Request audio permissions
- **Format mismatches**: Convert audio formats automatically

## üìà Success Metrics

### System Health Indicators
- **Success Rate > 95%**: Healthy system operation
- **Latency < 50ms**: Meeting real-time requirements  
- **Buffer Health > 50%**: Adequate processing capacity
- **Error Recovery < 5%**: Minimal intervention required

### Performance Targets
- Audio capture initialization: < 100ms
- Sample processing: < 15ms per sample
- Voice activity detection: < 5ms
- Quality enhancement: < 10ms

## üîß Development Tools

### Console Commands
```bash
# Monitor LED trail in real-time
tail -f /path/to/voicecoach.log | grep "üí°"

# Filter by component
tail -f /path/to/voicecoach.log | grep "üí°.*audio_capture"

# Show only errors
tail -f /path/to/voicecoach.log | grep "üí°.*‚ùå"
```

### Debug Macros
- `light_led!(component, id, data)` - Log successful operation
- `fail_led!(component, id, error)` - Log failed operation
- `GLOBAL_BREADCRUMB_SYSTEM` - Access global trail data
