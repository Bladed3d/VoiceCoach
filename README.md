- **COMMANDS-LEARNED.md** - Windows-specific command database

## ü§ñ Available Agents

Located in `.claude/agents/`:
- **task-breakdown-agent** - Breaks complex PRDs into granular tasks
- **project-manager** - Dashboard-integrated orchestration
- **debugging-agent** - Autonomous problem resolution
- **error-detection-agent** - Automated testing
- **error-correction-agent** - Autonomous bug fixes
- **breadcrumbs-agent** - LED debugging infrastructure
- **migration-agent** - Safe code organization
- Plus 6 more specialized development agents

## ‚ö° Getting Started

1. Open in Claude Code: `claude .`
2. Claude will automatically read the startup files
3. Begin development with full agent support

## üîß Configuration

- **Claude Settings**: `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`
- **MCP Servers**: Context7 for up-to-date library documentation
- **Permissions**: Granular command allowlists optimized for development

This setup provides the same autonomous development capabilities that made the Lightwalker project highly successful.
