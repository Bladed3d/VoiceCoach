- **800-899**: Coaching Logic (stage detection, trigger system, timing)
- **900-999**: Performance Metrics (talk time, effectiveness tracking)

## 🚀 Quick Integration Steps

### Step 1: Import and Initialize
```typescript
import { BreadcrumbTrail } from '@/lib/breadcrumb-system';

const YourCoachingComponent = () => {
  const trail = new BreadcrumbTrail('YourCoachingComponent');
  
  // Your existing code here...
};
```

### Step 2: Add LED Lights to Operations
```typescript
// Before: Simple operation
const handleAudioProcessing = async (audioData) => {
  const result = await processAudio(audioData);
  updateTranscription(result);
};

// After: With LED breadcrumbs
const handleAudioProcessing = async (audioData) => {
  trail.light(600, { operation: 'audio_processing_start', dataSize: audioData.length });
  
  try {
    trail.aiCoordination(601, 'audio', 'process_start');
    const result = await processAudio(audioData);
    trail.light(602, { processing_success: true, resultSize: result.length });
    
    trail.light(610, { operation: 'transcription_update' });
    updateTranscription(result);
    trail.light(611, { transcription_updated: true });
    
  } catch (error) {
    trail.fail(600, error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Add Coaching Intelligence Tracking
```typescript
// Track coaching triggers and metrics
const evaluateCoachingOpportunity = async (context) => {
  trail.coachingIntelligence(800, 'coaching_trigger_evaluation', { 
    stage: context.salesStage,
    talkTime: context.talkTimeRatio 
  });
  
  if (context.talkTimeRatio > 0.7) {
    trail.coachingIntelligence(801, 'talk_time_trigger', { 
      recommendation: 'suggest_listening_mode' 
    });
    await triggerCoachingPrompt('balance_talk_time');
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Track Performance Metrics
```typescript
// Track coaching effectiveness
const trackMetrics = () => {
  trail.metrics(900, {
    talkTimeRatio: calculateTalkTime(),
    discoveryQuestions: countDiscoveryQuestions(),
    closingAttempts: trackClosingAttempts(),
    salesStage: getCurrentStage(),
    coachingEffectiveness: calculateEffectiveness()
  });
};
```

## 🎯 Integration for Existing Files

To add LED breadcrumbs to your existing coaching orchestrator files:

1. **Import the BreadcrumbTrail** at the top of each file
2. **Initialize trail** in component constructor/top of component
3. **Add trail.light()** before each major operation
4. **Add trail.fail()** in catch blocks
5. **Use specialized methods** for coaching operations:
   - `trail.aiCoordination()` for AI system calls
   - `trail.coachingIntelligence()` for coaching triggers
   - `trail.metrics()` for performance tracking

## 🔍 Error Location Benefits

With LED breadcrumbs implemented, debugging becomes instant:

- **Before**: "Something is broken in the coaching system"
- **After**: "LED 701 failed in CoachingOrchestrator - Audio system initialization error"

- **Before**: "AI coordination isn't working"
- **After**: "LED 720 failed - RAG system connection timeout"

- **Before**: "Coaching triggers seem off"
- **After**: "LED 811 shows talk time trigger fired but LED 850 prompt delivery failed"

## 📈 Real-time Monitoring

The system provides live coaching session monitoring:

```javascript
// Real-time effectiveness monitoring
setInterval(() => {
  const metrics = window.debug.coaching.monitorEffectiveness();
  console.table(metrics);
}, 5000);

// Live conversation flow tracking
const flow = window.debug.coaching.getConversationFlow();
console.log('Conversation progression:', flow);
```

## 🎮 Production Ready

The LED breadcrumb system is designed for production use:

- **Zero performance impact** when not debugging
- **Smart trail limiting** (maintains last 1000 events)
- **Automatic cleanup** prevents memory leaks
- **Coaching-specific debug commands** for specialized analysis
- **Export functionality** for session analysis
