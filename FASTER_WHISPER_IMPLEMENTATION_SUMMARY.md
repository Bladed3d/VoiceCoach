## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Faster-Whisper Configuration**
```python
# Optimized for VoiceCoach requirements
model = WhisperModel("distil-whisper/distil-large-v3-ct2", 
                    device="cuda", 
                    compute_type="float16")

# Batched inference for throughput
batched_model = BatchedInferencePipeline(model=model)

# Optimized VAD parameters
vad_params = {
    "threshold": 0.6,
    "min_speech_duration_ms": 250,  # Fast response
    "min_silence_duration_ms": 300   # Quick chunking
}
```

### **Dual-Channel Audio Processing**
```python
# Enhanced channel separation
def separate_channels(self, stereo_audio):
    left_channel = stereo_audio[:, 0]   # User microphone
    right_channel = stereo_audio[:, 1]  # System audio (prospect)
    
    # Advanced enhancement with spectral analysis
    user_audio = self._enhance_channel(left_channel, right_channel)
    prospect_audio = self._enhance_channel(right_channel, left_channel)
    
    return user_audio, prospect_audio
```

### **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
```python
# Live performance tracking
@dataclass
class TranscriptionResult:
    text: str
    confidence: float
    latency_ms: float
    is_user: bool
    speaker_id: str
    audio_channel: int
    vad_confidence: float
    audio_quality: float
```
