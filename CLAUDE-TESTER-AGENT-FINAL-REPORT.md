## 🔗 LED Chain Analysis

### Questionnaire LED Sequence (480-486)
Based on code analysis of `KnowledgeBaseManager.tsx`:

```javascript
LED 480: Questionnaire initialization (useEffect mount trigger)
LED 481: Question 1 answered (Document Type)
LED 482: Question 2 answered (Learning Objective)  
LED 483: Question 3 answered (Business Challenge)
LED 484: Question 4 answered (Success Metrics)
LED 485: Question 5 answered (Critical Concepts)
LED 486: Questionnaire complete (isComplete = true)
```

**State Management**: Robust with inline editing support

### Document Processing LED Sequence (487-489-500)
```javascript
LED 487: Processing started (with questionnaire context integration)
LED 488: Context integrated (questionnaire data applied to analysis)
LED 489: Phase 1 complete (Claude analysis finished)
LED 500: Phase 2 start (Ollama enhancement begins)
```

**Phase Progression**: ✅ Correctly Implemented  
**Context Integration**: ✅ Questionnaire data properly passed to Claude analysis
